Soccer Quiz
===========

A quick bit of trivia about a few soccer teams
----------------------------------------------

Using jQuery, I built an interactive quiz about soccer. The style was just some basic CSS before I learned about Bootstrap.

The key lesson that I learned was how to manipulate to DOM using JavaScript, by way of jQuery.

*To Do*
- *add a different image in relation to each question*
- *randomize questions*
- *add more questions*
- *refactor with Angular*
